# The Confluence of Reliability, Security, Quality, and Speed


Reflecting on my career, I've always been part of early-stage startups and small teams. This means that I had to spend a lot of time learning different technologies and wearing different hats that were also sometimes stacked on top of each other.

Fast forward to 2023, and we see an economic impact across organizations where our teams are sometimes becoming more lean. More is expected from teams with less people, while some of the release timelines remain the same.

In this talk, I provide high-level insight into moving from writing code to being able to quickly instrument a microservice for observability. From there, we can review the expected coverage for quality, reliability, and security while taking advantage of a variety of tools that abstract some of the details away from us.

This talk is primarily for anyone in the Software Development or Quality space looking to accomplish more in smaller teams. The goal is to provide ideas and examples that you can take away and get started along with an open discussion at the end of the talk.
